    <description>[h2] DISCLAIMER [/h2]

[b]This mod is meant to be unbalanced, since the whole gimmick is that there are tons of D6s. You shouldn't download a mod adding tons of D6s if you want to have a balanced game.[/b]

[h1] Too Many D6s! [/h1]

The  Too Many D6s mod is a mod that implements over 15 new dices into the game, each with new and unique functions that can either ruin your run or turn your run disgustingly OP. Currently there are 19 dices, with 3 being secret joke dices.
